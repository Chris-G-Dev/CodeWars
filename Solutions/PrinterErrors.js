/* Details:
In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the
printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named 
with letters from a to m.
The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For 
example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the 
printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h 
then one time color a...

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and 
a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with 
letters not from a to m.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will output
the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose 
numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the 
control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters 
from a to z.
*/

/* Solution Explanation:
1 - Declare a variable of the good characters (goodChars)
2 - Loop through characters in argument, 's'. If the character isn't 
    included in goodChars, add 1 to badChars.
3 - Using a template literal, return the badChars divided by the
    length of the passed argument, 's'
*/

function printerError(s) {
  const goodChars = ("abcdefghijklm");
  let badChars = 0;
  for (let char of s) {
    !goodChars.includes(char) ? badChars++ : 0;
  }
  return `${badChars}/${s.length}`
}

// Examples:

printerError('aaabbbbhaijjjm') // 0/14
printerError('aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm') // 8/22
